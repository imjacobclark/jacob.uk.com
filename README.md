### My personal website

[https://www.jacob.uk.com](jacob.uk.com) is a Java 8 Dropwizard application, it is built with Maven in order to produce an Ã¼ber jar which can be deployed. 

It is also possible to run up this app with Docker - which will mount the code, built it through Maven and run the jar.

Travis-CI is enabled for this project which builds a new Docker image on every successful build and pushes the artefact to the Dockerhub.

The produced Docker image will then be baked onto a machine image through Packer and deployed onto a Digital Ocean droplet.
