[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/imjacobclark/jacobclark.xyz.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/imjacobclark/jacobclark.xyz)

[jacobclark.xyz](https://www.jacobclark.xyz) is a Java 8 Dropwizard application, it is built into an Ã¼ber jar with Maven.

Travis-CI is enabled for this project which builds a new Docker image on every successful build and pushes the artefact to the Dockerhub. In production the Docker image is baked onto a machine image with Packer and deployed onto a Digital Ocean droplet. 

[jacobclark.xyz](https://www.jacobclark.xyz) sports a responsive mobile friendly webpage for desktops and tablets, it also supports AMP for mobile devices. It is progressively enhanced through semantic HTML5 and as a result accessible to screen readers and text based web browsers.
